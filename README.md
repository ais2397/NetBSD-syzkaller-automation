# Sys2Syz
>  This tool is developed for the NetBSD Operating system and is done as a part of Google Summer of Code 2020 project with the NetBSD Foundation.

## Overview

Sys2Syz is a tool which automates the conversion of syscalls and other Ioctl calls to [syzkaller's](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) representation. This tool was created with a motive of increasing the syscall coverage for leveling up the support of syzkaller for NetBSD.

The tool supports generation of syzkaller descriptions for NetBSD device driver's ioctl calls. Following steps are involved:

- Extraction of all ioctl commands of a given device driver along with their arguments from the header files. Ioctl commands in NetBSD can be identified with the help of some specific macros(`_IO`, `_IOR`, `_IOW`, `_IOWR`) - ([core/Extractor.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Extractor.py)).
- Preprocessing of the device driver's files using compile_commands.json generated during the setup of tool using Bear - ([core/Bear.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Bear.py))
- XML files are generated by running c2xml on preprocessed device files. This eases the process of fetching the information related to arguments of commands - ([core/C2xml.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/C2xml.py))
- Generates descriptions for the ioctl commands and their arguments (builtin-types, arrays, pointers, structures and unions) using the XML files - ([core/Description.py](https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz/blob/gsoc-2020/core/Description.py))

## Installation
#### Prerequisites:
---
- [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) setup
- [NetBSD src](https://github.com/NetBSD/src) files

#### Build on Linux:
---
- Clone the repo
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/ais2397/sys2syz.git
 cd sys2syz
 ```
- Run the setup script

**Note:** This step requires
- NetBSD toolchain. 
- Directory storing compiled modules should be cleaned before performing this step
 ```shell
 ./setup.sh -b <path_to_netbsd_src>
 ```
 
 #### Usage
 ---
 To generate descriptions for a particular device driver(device_driver) run sys2syz.py:
```shell
python sys2syz.py -t <absolute_path_to_device_driver_source> -c compile_commands.json -v
```
This would generate a ```dev_<device_driver>.txt``` file in the ```out``` directory

## Results

Example description file generated by sys2syz for i2c device- 
```txt
#Autogenerated by sys2syz
include <i2c_io.h>

resource fd_i2c[fd]

syz_open_dev$I2C(dev ptr[in, string["/dev/i2c"]], id intptr, flags flags[open_flags]) fd_i2c

ioctl$I2C_IOCTL_EXEC(fd fd_i2c, cmd const[I2C_IOCTL_EXEC], arg ptr[out, i2c_ioctl_exec])

i2c_ioctl_exec {
iie_op	flags[i2c_op_t_flags]
iie_addr	int16
iie_buflen	len[iie_buf, intptr]
iie_buf	buffer[out]
iie_cmdlen	len[iie_cmd, intptr]
iie_cmd	buffer[out]
}
```

## Features

- Fetches ioctl calls of a particular device driver.
- Generates a file having syzkaller specific descriptions for fetched ioctl calls.

## TODO

Features yet to be implemented:
- Generation of syzkaller descriptions for syscalls.
- Generation of descriptions for functions, passed as arguments to syscalls.
- Detection of flag type and extract values of flags
- Calculating Attributes for structs and unions

## Contributions
Contributions to NetBSD and Syzkaller as a part of GSoC:

- [Example kernel module](https://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/sys/modules/examples/pollpal/) - implements poll(9)
